This is the same functions as in umap.plot. The only difference is that instead of
returning an ax and view in jupyter notebook, here `filename` is added as the first
argument and save the plot to it.

Also, we make it general to passing points directly, instead of umap objects.

    """Plot an embedding as points. Currently this only works
    for 2D embeddings. While there are many optional parameters
    to further control and tailor the plotting, you need only
    pass in the trained/fit umap model to get results. This plot
    utility will attempt to do the hard work of avoiding
    overplotting issues, and make it easy to automatically
    colour points by a categorical labelling or numeric values.

    This method is intended to be used within a Jupyter
    notebook with ``%matplotlib inline``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    filename: str, name of file to save the plot.
    points: array, shape (n_samples, 2) embedding data

    labels: array, shape (n_samples,) (optional, default None)
        An array of labels (assumed integer or categorical),
        one for each data sample.
        This will be used for coloring the points in
        the plot according to their label. Note that
        this option is mutually exclusive to the ``values``
        option.

    values: array, shape (n_samples,) (optional, default None)
        An array of values (assumed float or continuous),
        one for each sample.
        This will be used for coloring the points in
        the plot according to a colorscale associated
        to the total range of values. Note that this
        option is mutually exclusive to the ``labels``
        option.

    theme: string (optional, default None)
        A color theme to use for plotting. A small set of
        predefined themes are provided which have relatively
        good aesthetics. Available themes are:
           * 'blue'
           * 'red'
           * 'green'
           * 'inferno'
           * 'fire'
           * 'viridis'
           * 'darkblue'
           * 'darkred'
           * 'darkgreen'

    cmap: string (optional, default 'Blues')
        The name of a matplotlib colormap to use for coloring
        or shading points. If no labels or values are passed
        this will be used for shading points according to
        density (largely only of relevance for very large
        datasets). If values are passed this will be used for
        shading according the value. Note that if theme
        is passed then this value will be overridden by the
        corresponding option of the theme.

    color_key: dict or array, shape (n_categories) (optional, default None)
        A way to assign colors to categoricals. This can either be
        an explicit dict mapping labels to colors (as strings of form
        '#RRGGBB'), or an array like object providing one color for
        each distinct category being provided in ``labels``. Either
        way this mapping will be used to color points according to
        the label. Note that if theme
        is passed then this value will be overridden by the
        corresponding option of the theme.

    color_key_cmap: string (optional, default 'Spectral')
        The name of a matplotlib colormap to use for categorical coloring.
        If an explicit ``color_key`` is not given a color mapping for
        categories can be generated from the label list and selecting
        a matching list of colors from the given colormap. Note
        that if theme
        is passed then this value will be overridden by the
        corresponding option of the theme.

    background: string (optional, default 'white)
        The color of the background. Usually this will be either
        'white' or 'black', but any color name will work. Ideally
        one wants to match this appropriately to the colors being
        used for points etc. This is one of the things that themes
        handle for you. Note that if theme
        is passed then this value will be overridden by the
        corresponding option of the theme.

    width: int (optional, default 800)
        The desired width of the plot in pixels.

    height: int (optional, default 800)
        The desired height of the plot in pixels

    show_legend: bool (optional, default True)
        Whether to display a legend of the labels

    subset_points: array, shape (n_samples,) (optional, default None)
        A way to select a subset of points based on an array of boolean
        values.

    Returns
    -------
    result: matplotlib axis
        The result is a matplotlib axis with the relevant plot displayed.
        If you are using a notbooks and have ``%matplotlib inline`` set
        then this will simply display inline.

    """Create an interactive bokeh plot of a UMAP embedding.
    While static plots are useful, sometimes a plot that
    supports interactive zooming, and hover tooltips for
    individual points is much more desireable. This function
    provides a simple interface for creating such plots. The
    result is a bokeh plot that will be displayed in a notebook.

    Note that more complex tooltips etc. will require custom
    code -- this is merely meant to provide fast and easy
    access to interactive plotting.

    Parameters
    ----------
    umap_object: trained UMAP object
        A trained UMAP object that has a 2D embedding.

    labels: array, shape (n_samples,) (optional, default None)
        An array of labels (assumed integer or categorical),
        one for each data sample.
        This will be used for coloring the points in
        the plot according to their label. Note that
        this option is mutually exclusive to the ``values``
        option.

    values: array, shape (n_samples,) (optional, default None)
        An array of values (assumed float or continuous),

        This will be used for coloring the points in
        the plot according to a colorscale associated
        to the total range of values. Note that this
        option is mutually exclusive to the ``labels``
        option.

    hover_data: DataFrame, shape (n_samples, n_tooltip_features)
    (optional, default None)
        A dataframe of tooltip data. Each column of the dataframe
        should be a Series of length ``n_samples`` providing a value
        for each data point. Column names will be used for

    cmap: string (optional, default 'Blues')
        The name of a matplotlib colormap to use for coloring
        or shading points. If no labels or values are passed
