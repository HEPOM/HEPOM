 # Each line lists the molecule charge and bond energies of a molecule. The number of
 # items in each line is equal to 1 + 2*N, where N is the number bonds. The first item is
 # the moledule charge. The first half of the remaining items are bond energies and the
 # next half values are indicators (0 or 1) to specify whether the bond energy exist in
 # the dataset. A value of 0 means the corresponding bond en ergy should be ignored,
 # whatever its value is.
